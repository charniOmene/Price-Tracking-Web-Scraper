One of the main reasons why Johnstone advocates for a plant-based diet is because of its numerous health benefits. According to various studies and organizations, eating more plant foods and less animal foods can lower your risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and obesity[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. This is because plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that help regulate blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, inflammation, and immune function[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. Plant foods also tend to be lower in calories, saturated fat, and cholesterol than animal foods, which can help you maintain a healthy weight and prevent excess fat accumulation[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^].
 
Another reason why Johnstone promotes a plant-based diet is because of its positive impact on the environment. Animal agriculture is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, land degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss[^3^]. By contrast, plant-based agriculture uses less water, land, energy, and resources than animal-based agriculture[^3^]. By reducing your consumption of meat and dairy products, you can reduce your environmental footprint and help preserve the planet for future generations[^3^]. Johnstone also believes that a plant-based diet is more ethical and compassionate than a diet that involves killing and exploiting animals for food[^1^] [^2^]. He argues that animals have feelings and rights just like humans do, and that we should respect their lives and avoid causing them harm[^1^] [^2^].
 
However, adopting a plant-based diet is not without its challenges. Some people may find it difficult to change their eating habits, especially if they are used to eating meat and dairy products on a regular basis. Some people may also face social pressure or criticism from their family, friends, or society for choosing a different way of eating. Some people may also have concerns about getting enough protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, and other nutrients from plant sources. Johnstone addresses these challenges in his book and offers practical solutions and tips on how to overcome them. He also provides examples of what he eats in a typical day and how he balances his nutrition needs with his physical activity levels[^1^]. He also shares his personal experiences and stories of how he transformed his health and life with a plant-based diet[^1^].
