However, not all PC gamers can enjoy this game smoothly, as it requires a minimum of 6GB of RAM to run properly. If you have a 4GB RAM PC, you may experience lag, stuttering, crashes, or errors when playing Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that can help you fix these issues and play the game on your low-spec PC.
 
Here are some steps you can try to play Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on a 4GB RAM PC:
 
1. Download and install the latest patch for the game from the official website[^3^]. This may fix some bugs and improve the performance of the game.
2. Lower the graphics settings of the game to the minimum. You can do this by going to the Options menu and selecting Graphics. Reduce the resolution, texture quality, shadow quality, anti-aliasing, and other settings to the lowest possible values.
3. Disable any unnecessary background programs or services that may be consuming your RAM or CPU resources. You can use Task Manager to check which processes are running on your PC and end them if they are not essential.
4. Use a 4GB RAM fix tool that can modify the game files and allow it to run on a 4GB RAM PC. There are several tools available online that claim to do this, but be careful as some of them may contain viruses or malware. One of the most popular and trusted tools is called Re:GAMER\_XV[^1^], which you can download from YouTube. Follow the instructions in the video to apply the fix and launch the game.

By following these steps, you may be able to play Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on a 4GB RAM PC without any major problems. However, keep in mind that these are not guaranteed solutions and your experience may vary depending on your hardware and software configuration.
