## Chapter One: The Definition and Objectives of Fiqh
 
In this chapter, the author defines fiqh as the science of deriving legal rulings from the Quran and the Sunnah, and explains its importance and necessity for Muslims. He also discusses the objectives and purposes of fiqh, which are to protect and promote the interests and welfare of humans in this life and the hereafter. He also outlines the main sources and evidences of fiqh, which are the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus (ijma), and the analogy (qiyas).
 
### The Quran
 
The Quran is the primary and most authoritative source of fiqh, as it is the word of Allah revealed to His final messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Quran contains general and specific commands and prohibitions, principles and guidelines, stories and parables, that regulate the beliefs and actions of Muslims. The Quran also provides the criteria and standards for judging between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, good and evil.
 
### The Sunnah
 
The Sunnah is the second source of fiqh, as it is the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who was sent by Allah as a model and example for Muslims to follow. The Sunnah explains and clarifies the Quran, provides details and specifications for its general rulings, supplements and complements its teachings, and abrogates or specifies some of its verses.
 
### The Consensus (Ijma)
 
The consensus (ijma) is the third source of fiqh, as it is the agreement of the scholars and jurists of Islam on a legal issue that is not explicitly stated in the Quran or the Sunnah. The consensus is based on the assumption that Allah would not allow His ummah (community) to agree on an error or a deviation from His guidance. The consensus also reflects the collective wisdom and understanding of the scholars who have studied and mastered the Quran and the Sunnah.
 
### The Analogy (Qiyas)
 
The analogy (qiyas) is the fourth source of fiqh, as it is the process of applying a known ruling from the Quran or the Sunnah to a new case that has a similar cause or reason. The analogy is based on the principle that Allah's rulings are consistent and coherent, and that He does not legislate arbitrarily or randomly. The analogy also enables the scholars to deal with new situations and issues that arise with changing times and circumstances.
