## How to Play Don Battle Stadium 17 Ai Dota Maps
 
Don Battle Stadium 17 Ai Dota Maps is a team-based game mode where you have to destroy the enemy base while defending your own. You can choose from two teams: Team D (Dragon Ball Z) or Team ON (One Piece and Naruto). Each team has 25 heroes with different abilities and stats.
 
The game starts with a hero selection screen where you can pick your hero or let the game randomly assign one for you. You can also choose the difficulty level of the AI bots if you are playing against them. The higher the difficulty, the smarter and stronger they are.
 
After choosing your hero, you will spawn at your base where you can buy items from shops or upgrade your skills. You can also access a special shop called "Don Shop" where you can buy unique items that enhance your hero's power or give you extra abilities.
 
The map has three lanes: top, middle, and bottom. Each lane has towers that protect your base and attack enemies that come near them. You have to push your lane by killing enemy creeps and heroes while avoiding tower damage. You can also use teleport scrolls or special skills to move between lanes or back to your base.
 
The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy's main building called "Don Tower". To do that, you have to destroy all the towers in one lane and reach the enemy base. The Don Tower is very strong and has a lot of health, so you need to coordinate with your team and use your skills wisely to take it down.
 
The game ends when either team's Don Tower is destroyed or when the timer runs out. The team with more kills or more tower damage wins the game.
