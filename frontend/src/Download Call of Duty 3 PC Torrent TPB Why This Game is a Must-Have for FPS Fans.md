In the single-player campaign, players can choose to play as one of four Allied soldiers: an American infantryman, a British commando, a Canadian rifleman, or a Polish tank driver. Each soldier has a different personality and voice, and interacts with other characters during the missions. The campaign consists of 14 missions that span across France, Belgium, and Germany, following the historical events of Operation Overlord, Operation Cobra, and Operation Luttich. The missions vary in objectives, such as capturing enemy positions, destroying bridges, rescuing hostages, and defending towns. The game also features cinematic cutscenes that show the war from different perspectives.
 
In the multiplayer mode, players can compete online with up to 16 players on various maps based on the single-player locations. There are six multiplayer modes to choose from: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Headquarters, War, and Single Flag Capture. Each mode has different rules and objectives for the teams to accomplish. Players can also customize their character's appearance and weapons loadout before joining a match. Additionally, players can earn experience points and rank up their skills based on their chosen class: Rifleman, Light Assault, Heavy Assault, Medic, Scout, or Support. Each class has different weapons and abilities that can help their team win.
