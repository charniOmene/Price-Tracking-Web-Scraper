Curse of Chucky is a 2013 horror movie that marks the sixth installment in the Chucky franchise, which began with Child's Play in 1988. The movie follows Nica (Fiona Dourif), a young woman who receives a mysterious package containing a red-haired doll named Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif). Soon, she and her family are terrorized by the doll, who is possessed by the spirit of a notorious serial killer. Curse of Chucky is a return to the more serious and scary tone of the original movies, after the previous two sequels, Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky, were more comedic and self-referential.
