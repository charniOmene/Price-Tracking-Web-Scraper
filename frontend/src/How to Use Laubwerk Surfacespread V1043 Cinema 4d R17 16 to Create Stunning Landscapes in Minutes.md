## How to Use the SurfaceSPREAD Object to Scatter Objects on Surfaces and Splines
  
The SurfaceSPREAD object is the main component of Laubwerk Surfacespread V1043. It allows you to scatter objects on surfaces and splines with various parameters and options. You can use it to distribute Laubwerk Plants or any other object that you want.
  
To use the SurfaceSPREAD object, follow these steps:

1. Create a surface or a spline that you want to scatter objects on. For example, you can create a plane or a landscape object for a surface, or a helix or a bezier spline for a spline.
2. Create an object that you want to scatter on the surface or spline. For example, you can create a cube or a sphere, or drag a Laubwerk Plant from the Content Browser.
3. Go to Plugins > Laubwerk > SurfaceSPREAD Object or click on the SurfaceSPREAD icon in the toolbar.
4. A new SurfaceSPREAD object will appear in the Object Manager. Drag your surface or spline under it as a child.
5. Drag your object under the SurfaceSPREAD object as well, but make sure it is not a child of the surface or spline.
6. Select the SurfaceSPREAD object and go to the Attributes Manager. Here you can adjust various settings for your scattering, such as: 8cf37b1e13
