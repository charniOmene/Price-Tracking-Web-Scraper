EX4 files are compiled programs that run on the MetaTrader 4 platform, a popular software for forex trading and algorithmic trading. MQ4 files are the source code of these programs, written in the MQL4 language. If you want to modify, debug, or learn from an EX4 file, you need to convert it to an MQ4 file first.
 
However, converting EX4 files to MQ4 files is not a simple task. EX4 files are protected by encryption and obfuscation techniques that make them hard to decompile and reverse engineer. Moreover, decompiling EX4 files may violate the intellectual property rights of the original developers, who may not want to share their code with others.

In this section, we will show you an example of an EX4 file and an MQ4 file, and explain the differences between them. We will use a simple moving average crossover expert advisor as an example. This is a common trading strategy that uses two moving averages of different periods to generate buy and sell signals.
 
An EX4 file is a binary file that contains the compiled code of the expert advisor. It has a .ex4 extension and can be executed by MetaTrader 4. It looks like this:
 `

As you can see, an EX4 file is not readable by humans. It consists of hexadecimal numbers that represent the machine code of the expert advisor. You cannot modify or understand the code without decompiling it first.
 
An MQ4 file is a text file that contains the source code of the expert advisor. It has a .mq4 extension and can be edited by any text editor or MetaEditor. It looks like this:
