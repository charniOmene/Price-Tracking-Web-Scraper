## What You Need
 
Before you start, you will need the following:
 
**DOWNLOAD --->>> [https://persifalque.blogspot.com/?d=2uNiVS](https://persifalque.blogspot.com/?d=2uNiVS)**


 
- A copy of Unreal Gold on Steam or GOG.
- The Unreal Gold Patch 227i from [OldUnreal](https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/oldunreal-patches/). This patch fixes many bugs and adds new features to the game. You can also use the newer patch 227j, but it is not compatible with the DirectX 11 renderer.
- The High-Resolution Unreal Skins (UnrealHD v3.1 Full) from [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/high-resolution-unreal-skins/downloads/unrealhd-v30-full). This mod replaces the original low-resolution textures with 4K ones.
- The Unreal DirectX11 Renderer for UT, UG, Rune and DX from [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/unreal-directx11-renderer-for-ut-ug-rune-and-dx). This mod enables DirectX 11 support and adds effects like tessellation, ambient occlusion, and screen space reflections.
- The Lucky Patcher app from [LuckyPatchers](https://www.luckypatchers.com/download/). This app allows you to modify the game files and apply patches without rooting your device.
