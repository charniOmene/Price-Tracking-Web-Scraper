Rufus is a popular tool for creating bootable USB drives from ISO files. However, some users may encounter an error message that says "ISO image extraction failure" when trying to use Rufus. This error means that Rufus cannot read or extract the contents of the ISO file properly. There are several possible causes and solutions for this error, which we will discuss in this article.
 
## Cause 1: Corrupted or Incompatible ISO File
 
One of the most common reasons for the ISO image extraction failure error is that the ISO file you are using is corrupted or incompatible with Rufus. This can happen if you downloaded the ISO file from an unreliable source, if the download was interrupted or incomplete, or if the ISO file is not supported by Rufus.

To check if your ISO file is corrupted or incompatible, you can use Rufus to compute its checksums and compare them with the official ones provided by the source of the ISO file. To do this, click on the (â) button next to SELECT (Rufus 3.0 or later) or the # button at the bottom of the Rufus interface (Rufus 2.18 or earlier) after selecting your ISO file[^1^]. Then, perform an internet search for the official checksums of your ISO file and see if they match. If they don't match, it means your ISO file is corrupted or modified and you need to download it again from a trusted source.
 
## Cause 2: Faulty or Inaccessible USB Drive
 
Another possible cause for the ISO image extraction failure error is that your USB drive is faulty or inaccessible by Rufus. This can happen if your USB drive has bad sectors, is write-protected, is formatted with an unsupported file system, or is connected to a faulty USB port.
 
To check if your USB drive is faulty or inaccessible, you can use Rufus to run a bad blocks check on it. To do this, click on the SHOW ADVANCED DRIVE PROPERTIES button (the one with a white triangle) at the bottom of the Rufus interface and then check the BAD BLOCKS option. Then, select how many passes you want to perform and click on START[^1^]. Rufus will scan your USB drive for any errors and report them to you. If Rufus finds any bad blocks on your USB drive, it means your USB drive is damaged and you need to replace it with a new one.
 
## Cause 3: Interference from Antivirus or Other Software
 
A third possible cause for the ISO image extraction failure error is that your antivirus or other software is interfering with Rufus. This can happen if your antivirus or other software blocks Rufus from accessing your ISO file or your USB drive, modifies the contents of your ISO file or your USB drive, or causes conflicts with Rufus.
