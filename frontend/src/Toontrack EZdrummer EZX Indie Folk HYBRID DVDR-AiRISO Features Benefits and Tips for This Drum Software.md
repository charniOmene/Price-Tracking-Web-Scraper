If you are looking for a versatile and authentic drum sound for your indie folk productions, you might want to check out the **Toontrack EZdrummer EZX Indie Folk HYBRID DVDR-AiRISO** expansion pack. This pack contains three complete vintage kits from the 1940s to the 1960s, sampled with both sticks and mallets, as well as two tambourines, a hi-hat mounted tambourine jingle, an extra kick and snare and a 28" floor tom. The drums were recorded at the Avast! Recording Co. in Seattle, home to bands such as Fleet Foxes, The Shins and Band Of Horses[^1^].

The drums have a warm, organic and intimate tone that suits the indie folk genre perfectly. You can also tweak the sound with the built-in effects and mixer presets. The pack also includes MIDI files performed by sampling drummer Stephen Belans, covering a range of indie folk styles and grooves[^1^].
